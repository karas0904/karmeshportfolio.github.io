            <article><h1>C LANGUAGE</h1>
            <br><p>Learned this beautiful yet hard to understand language in my previous semester.Practiced the basics such as if else,loops and operators.
                got to know about the pointers and functions which hlped me in many other topics as well. Came though small topics yet most important
                like file i/o dynamic memory allocation. The most intresting part was the strings as is gave me many solutions and answers which for my 
                questions.Which made me possible to make projects on C 
                language from which one them you can see on this webpage and the others on my github profile.It was intresting as it was my first language to 
                learn and cover most of its topics.

            <article><h1>JAVASCRIPT</h1>

        <div class="grid-item">
            <article><h1>UI/UX</h1>
                <br><p>Its not a computer language but definetly a skill as many of the companies are hiring ui/ux developers 
                    instead of frontend. It gave me an ides to how to make your webpage/website user friendly and more attractice 
                    example the colour combination,grids,buttons placement etc,
                </p></article>

        <div class="grid-item">
            <article><h1>Data structure and algorithms</h1>
            <br><p>I would'nt say DSA is my strong point on practical level but defenetly got many answers of it. It made release how 
                companies manage and modify such large amount of data. Many topics like queue,stack,linked list and arrays with different operation 
                such as tranversal,instert,delete,sorting and many more gave me different perspective of every problems to solve.

        <div class="grid-item">
            <article><h1>CSS/HTML</h1>
            <br><p>The topic which is most intresting to me as it gave me the idea of coding at age of 14 and made me deside to the choose CSE. 
                 The most intresting part of it is you cant learn it fully and yet do wonders in it.To brushen up my skills i did take web development 
                 course from youtube. As you can see this webpage which is designed by html,css and a litte bit of javascript.The most fun part of the
                 developing a webpage is to make it responsive means no problem should be there while seeing this in phone and the topic @import made it 
                 look so easy. The coding of it is like reading english there's no roler coaster to it. The most  important topics of it is the DIV's and 
                 classes from which you can access any section and modify it.

        <h5>AT UNIVERSITY :</h5>
        <p>Currently studing in SRM university, in computer science department though which I came across <span>C language,C++ and the most important course "Data 
        structures and algorithms"</span> the tests,assignments and code platforms helped me alot to stregenthen my coding skills in these particular languages. Talking about
        ALP which is the basic computer language. In which I learned how the registors and stored in 1's or 0's.<span>Data structure gave lot of answers of sorting
        ,deleting,inserting,traversing</sapn> that how do big companies work with this much of DATA.</p>
        <H5>ON PERSONAL LEVEL :</H5>
        <p>During my third semester <span>I focused on Web development which gave me the idea of html and css and a bite of javascript</span>. For example you can see this 
        webpage which is designed by me.<span>Through the course I also came across UI/UX</span> which helps the developer to make the webpage/website user friendly 
        and responsive and as <span>you can see the color combinations of every Div's,card,span,p and etc in this webpage.</span></p>
