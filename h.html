                <p>The Cenotaph is a war memorial on Whitehall in London. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, 
                    it was unveiled in 1920 as the United Kingdom's national memorial to the British and 
                    Commonwealth dead of the First World War. It was rededicated in 1946 to also commemorate
                     those who had fallen in the Second World War, and has since come to represent British 
                     casualties from later conflicts. The word cenotaph is derived from Greek, meaning 
                     'empty tomb'; the monument symbolises the absence of the dead and is a focal point 
                     for public mourning. The original temporary Cenotaph was erected in 1919 for a parade 
                     celebrating the end of the First World War; calls for it to be rebuilt in permanent form 
                     began almost immediately. The permanent Cenotaph was unveiled by George V on 11 November
                      1920 in a ceremony combined with the repatriation of the Unknown Warrior. The National 
                      Service of Remembrance is held annually at</p>
